					"Exams and interviews can be so stressful! But there's no such thing as wasted effort. Honing your work ethic and recognizing your true stengths is a lifelong challenge, so don't sweat the smaller failures.",
					"Perspective, my dude. What would the you from 5 years ago think about where you are right now? The fact is that you've accomplished so much and come so far. The trick is to aim for a position that you would be proud to be in within the next 5 years. Growth is all that matters",
					"You're pretty weird. If other people pass on you for that though, they're just dumb. Or maybe they just don't like cute bbs. Or both.",
					"Owning your emotion is fine. But remember that sadness is all a byproduct of the mind. It's a clash of your ideals versus your reality. So rather than simply crying, think to yourself how to build that bridge between those two."
